A professional portfolio page to spotlight my work as a full stack web developer for potential employers.

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples So That I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
